The gripper then closes around the block, securing it firmly. As the gripper lifts, the block rises along with it, indicating that the block is being held by the gripper. The camera angle shifts slightly, revealing more of the surrounding area, including a laptop and some cables on the left side of the frame. The block remains securely held by the gripper throughout the sequence."}
{"clip": "videos/approach2_exploration/derived_inputs/clips_slow_sliding/success/success_1_10s.mp4", "fps": 8, "text": "The gripper moves slightly to the left, adjusting its position relative to the orange block. The orange block remains stationary on the wooden surface, with no significant movement observed. The gripper does not appear to interact directly with the block during this sequence. The block stays in place, and there are no indications of it being dropped or disappearing. The wooden surface provides a stable base for the block, and no other objects come into view during the video."}
{"clip": "videos/approach2_exploration/derived_inputs/clips_slow_sliding/success/success_1_12s.mp4", "fps": 8, "text": "The gripper is positioned above an orange block, which is attached to a gray metal structure. The gripper moves slightly, adjusting its position relative to the block. The orange block remains stationary on the surface, and there is no indication of it being dropped or falling. The block does not move significantly during the observed period. The background consists of a dark wooden floor, and no other objects are visible near the block. The block does not disappear from view, and there is no evidence of another object picking it up. The gripper's movements are subtle, primarily involving minor adjustments in position rather than significant actions like dropping or lifting."}
{"clip": "videos/approach2_exploration/derived_inputs/clips_slow_sliding/success/success_1_2s.mp4", "fps": 8, "text": "The gripper moves downward, positioning itself above the orange block. It then closes around the block, securing it firmly. The gripper lifts the block slightly off the surface before moving it to the right side of the frame. The block is then released, landing on the surface below. Throughout the sequence, the camera remains focused on the interaction between the gripper and the block, capturing the precise movements and the block's position relative to the gripper."}
{"clip": "videos/approach2_exploration/derived_inputs/clips_slow_sliding/success/success_1_4s.mp4", "fps": 8, "text": "The gripper descends towards the orange block, which is positioned on a flat surface. As the gripper approaches, it begins to close around the block, securing it firmly. The block remains stationary until fully grasped by the gripper. The gripper then lifts the block slightly off the surface, indicating the start of the lifting process. The block appears to be made of a smooth, solid material and has a distinct shape with rounded edges. The background includes a wooden surface and some indistinguishable objects, but they remain static throughout the sequence. There is no indication of the block falling or disappearing during this interaction."}
{"clip": "videos/approach2_exploration/derived_inputs/clips_slow_sliding/success/success_1_6s.mp4", "fps": 8, "text": "The gripper closes around the orange block, securing it firmly. The block is lifted slightly off the surface as the gripper adjusts its grip. The orange block is then moved upwards and to the right, away from its initial position. The block appears to be held securely by the gripper throughout this movement. The background remains consistent, with no significant changes in the environment. The orange block is not dropped or fallen during this sequence."}
{"clip": "videos/approach2_exploration/derived_inputs/clips_slow_sliding/success/success_1_8s.mp4", "fps": 8, "text": "The gripper is positioned above an orange block, which is initially resting on a dark wooden surface. The gripper then moves downward, grasping the orange block firmly. As the gripper descends, the block is lifted off the surface, indicating that it has been successfully picked up. The block appears to be a solid, cubic shape with smooth edges and a matte finish. The gripper continues to hold the block steadily as it moves upward, suggesting that the block is being transported or prepared for placement elsewhere. The background remains consistent throughout the sequence, with no significant changes in the environment or additional objects entering the frame. The focus remains solely on the interaction between the gripper and the orange block."}
