Shortly after, the gripper descends again, this time picking up a stuffed toy. The stuffed toy is a bunny with a green foot labeled \"FOOT\" and an orange button labeled \"MUSIC.\" The bunny has a red nose and blue eyes. The gripper then ascends once more, carrying the bunny. The orange block is briefly visible before the gripper moves away. The stuffed toy is held securely by the gripper throughout the sequence."}

As the gripper approaches, it makes contact with the block, causing it to shift slightly. The orange block remains in the vicinity of the monitor, and there is no significant movement of other objects in the immediate area. The block does not disappear or fall; instead, it stays in place as the gripper interacts with it. The monitor and its cables remain static throughout the interaction."}
